# Project_Customer_Purchases
Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis to explore and visualize customer purchase data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

# 📦 Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

A deep dive into customer behavior patterns using real-world purchase data. This project walks through comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, uncovering meaningful insights that drive better business decisions.

## 📚 Project Summary

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior from a dataset containing demographics, income levels, spending scores, and product categories. Through this analysis, we answer key business questions like:

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- How does gender impact spending?
- What is the average spending score by age group?
- Are there patterns between income, frequency, and purchase amount?
